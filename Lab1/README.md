# Lab 1

This lab assignment details can be found by doing a quick search on Google as EEL 5722C.


## Objectives

Objective of the assignment as follows:
  * Using the 7-segment LED displays on the Basys3 board to show numbers between 0-99.
  * Using the buttons on the Basys3 to control the ones and tens of the number that will be displayed on the 7-segment LED displays.
  * 1 button should increment the ones, and the other one should increment the tens.
  * The highest number would be 99. When the push button counter reaches 99, it should return to 00 to start over.

As for the bonus part of the experiment covers the following:
  * The button control should be removed from the design.
  * Instead of the buttons, the increment should be done by the clock signal.
  * Like before, then the display reaches 99, the counter should return to 00 to make the loop again.

## Usage

Use Basys3 FPGA to implement design. Project is done with Vivado 2020.2.
