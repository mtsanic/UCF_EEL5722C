# Lab 5

This lab assignment details can be found by doing a quick search on Google as EEL 5722C.


## Objectives

Objective of the assignment as follows:
  * Using block memory generator store image.
  * Accessing the addresses in the memory to show image on VGA display.
  * Connect PS/2 based keyboard to Basys3 FPGA.
  * Using QWERTY numeral key "0" to apply low pass filter on the image.
  * Low pass filter should use the coefficients : 1/9	[1	1	1;	1	1	1;	1	1	1].
  * Use another memory to save the computed data.
  * Transfer the computed data original memory to save the results and show on VGA display.
  * Repeat the cycle every time we press QWERTY numeral "0".

## Usage

Use Basys3 FPGA to implement design. Project is done with Vivado 2020.2.
